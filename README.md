### üçø Introduction to the 5GMETA platform
5GMETA is an open data-centric Internet of Things (IoT) messaging platform for Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) applications and service providers. The 5GMETA Platform creates a CAM data monetization ecosystem that allows different stakeholders along the data value chain to exploit data in a more effective and profitable way.‚Äã

A fundamental principle supported by the 5GMETA Platform is that of achieving a total decoupling between Data Producers and Data Consumers. This means that Data Producers do not need to be directly connected to Data Consumers. The 5GMETA Platform acts as a broker between Data Producers (vehicles or RSUs) and Data consumers (third-party applications or services). However, the 5GMETA Platform is not a simple publish-subscribe broker, and it includes functions for data management, data monetization and cybersecurity as well as providing data access mechanisms. In contrast with a Data Lake, the 5GMETA Platform provides live data delivery. The users of the 5GMETA Platform receive the data from the subscribed dataflows in a continuous manner with no storage service within the 5GMETA Platform rather than the required memory buffering. 

These two videos are a good starting point to learn more about the motivation and the basic concepts of the 5GMETA Platform:
